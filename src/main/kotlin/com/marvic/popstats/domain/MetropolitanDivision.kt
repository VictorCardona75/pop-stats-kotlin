/**
 * The `MetropolitanDivision` Class represents a county or group of counties (or equivalent
 * entities) delineated within a larger metropolitan statistical area, provided that the larger
 * metropolitan statistical area contains a single core with a population of at least 2.5 million
 * and other criteria are met.
 *
 * A Metropolitan Division consists of one or more main/secondary counties that represent an
 * employment center or centers, plus adjacent counties associated with the main/secondary county
 * or counties through commuting ties. Not all metropolitan statistical areas will contain
 * metropolitan divisions.
 *
 * @constructor creates a new instance using the specified values
 * @property counties the counties that make up this division
